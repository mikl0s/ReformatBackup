Project Description

Overview:
This project is a standalone Windows 11 utility packaged as a single executable (.exe) file, designed to simplify the process of backing up user settings and data for installed applications. It combines a lightweight, browser-based interface with powerful backup functionality, leveraging 7zip compression to create portable, timestamped archives of app-specific user data.

What It Does:
The tool scans a Windows 11 system to identify all installed applications, their approximate sizes, and their storage locations across drives. Through an embedded web interface, users can select apps to back up, specify a backup destination, and generate highly compressed 7zip files containing user data (e.g., AppData folders, Documents if applicable). Each backup is uniquely named with the app name and timestamp (e.g., notepad-20250402-190431.7z), making it easy to manage and restore settings later. Additional features like cached scans and dynamic web loading enhance development efficiency.

Niche It Fills:
This utility targets a niche between general-purpose backup software and app-specific configuration tools. Unlike broad backup solutions (e.g., Acronis, File History), it focuses exclusively on user settings and data tied to installed applications, offering a lightweight, portable alternative for tech-savvy users, IT professionals, or gamers who need to preserve app configurations without full system backups. Its single-file design and browser-based UI make it uniquely accessible—no installation, no dependencies, just a double-click to run—while the 7zip integration ensures efficient, space-saving backups.

Use Cases:
Migrating app settings to a new PC without reinstalling everything.
Safeguarding game saves or software preferences before a system reformat.
Rapid iteration during development with cached scans and a dynamic web interface.
Value Proposition:
It’s a simple, all-in-one solution for app-specific backups, filling the gap for users who want control over their software data without the overhead of complex tools. The single .exe format ensures portability, while the web container offers a modern, flexible interface—perfect for both end-users and developers tweaking the tool.
